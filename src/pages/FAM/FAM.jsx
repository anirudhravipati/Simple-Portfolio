              In an increasingly urbanized environment, the paradox that is
              present is that while one lives in a setting where they are
              surrounded by people but also tend to become lonely - especially
              if theyâ€™re shy or if they come from a more communal space such as

              The philosophy of FAM is change through action coupled with
              meaningful reflection. It takes the unlikely combination of an

              step out into the world by gently guiding and checking in with the
              user
